# Content Predator - Copy Style Guide

This app uses aggressive, confrontational copy throughout. No soft language, no corporate speak, no "please" or "thank you."

## Voice Principles

1. **Direct and Brutal** - Say what it is. No fluff.
2. **Action-Oriented** - Commands, not suggestions.
3. **Honest** - If something fails, say it broke.
4. **Impatient** - No coddling the user.
5. **Militaristic** - Hunt, weaponize, attack, blood.

## Examples from the App

## UI Copy Patterns

### Buttons
- ALL CAPS for primary actions
- Short verbs: SCAN, COPY, DELETE, MARK USED
- Active voice, imperative mood
- No "Click here to..." - just the action

### Headings
- ALL CAPS for major sections
- Title Case for subsections
- Direct statements, not questions
- "TOP OPPORTUNITIES" not "Your Opportunities"

### Form Labels
- ALL CAPS
- No colons or trailing punctuation
- "X/TWITTER NOTIFICATIONS" not "Twitter Notifications:"

### Error Messages
- Start with what broke
- No apologizing ("Sorry, but...")
- End with what to do or accept failure
- "API call failed. Check your key or give up."

### Success Messages
- Confirm what happened
- Tell them what to do next
- No celebration or emoji
- "Content generated. Now go post it."

## When in Doubt

Ask: "Would a drill sergeant say this?"
- Yes → Use it
- No → Make it harder

Or: "Does this sound like comfortable Christianity?"
- Yes → Rewrite it confrontational
- No → Good to go

The app copy should match the brand voice: Direct. Brutal. No middle ground.
