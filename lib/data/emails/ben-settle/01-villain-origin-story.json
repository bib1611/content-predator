  "body": "A few years ago I talked with a marketer who sent an email about his \"villain origin story.\"\n\nBasically, how he went from good guy to bad guy.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nIt was one of his most profitable emails ever.\n\nHere's the thing:\n\nVillain origin stories are powerful.\n\nEspecially in email.\n\nBecause nobody relates to the hero who has it all figured out.\n\nThey relate to the guy who got screwed over, got mad, and decided to burn it all down.\n\nThat's the guy people want to follow.\n\nThat's the guy people buy from.\n\nMost marketers don't get this.\n\nThey're too busy pretending to be the hero.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nThe \"villains\" are making all the money.\n\nThis is why my Email Players subscribers write emails that sell.\n\nThey embrace the villain.\n\nThey tell the uncomfortable truths.\n\nThey don't pretend to be something they're not.\n\nAnd their customers love them for it.\n\nMore on that tomorrow.\n\nBen Settle\n\nP.S. Want to know the #1 mistake \"hero\" marketers make that kills their sales?\n\nI'll tell you tomorrow.",
