  "body": "This'll probably piss some people off.\n\nBut it's true:\n\nThe Nazis were masters of propaganda.\n\nEvil? Yes.\n\nEffective? Also yes.\n\nAnd one of their chief propaganda techniques was something called \"The Big Lie.\"\n\nThe idea?\n\nTell a lie so big, so audacious, that people assume it must be true.\n\nBecause who would have the balls to lie THAT big?\n\nNow here's where this gets interesting for email:\n\nMost marketers lie small.\n\nThey exaggerate a little.\n\nThey stretch the truth.\n\nThey're scared to make bold claims.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nThe guys making all the money?\n\nThey're not lying.\n\nBut they ARE making big, bold, audacious claims.\n\nClaims so big they seem unbelievable.\n\nBut unlike the Nazis, these claims are TRUE.\n\nAnd that's the secret:\n\nDon't make small, believable claims that people ignore.\n\nMake big, outrageous claims that are actually TRUE.\n\nThat's what I teach in Email Players.\n\nHow to make claims so big people HAVE to pay attention.\n\nBut back them up with proof so strong they can't help but believe.\n\nAnyway.\n\nThat's all for today.\n\nBen Settle",
