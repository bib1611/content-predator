  "body": "In 1915, copywriter Elbert Hubbard died on the Lusitania.\n\nHe was one of the highest paid writers of his time.\n\nAnd he had a secret weapon:\n\nHe never tried to convince anyone of anything.\n\nInstead?\n\nHe just told stories.\n\nStories that made his point without making his point.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nWhen he wanted to sell a book about failure, he didn't write \"10 Ways To Avoid Failure.\"\n\nHe wrote a story about a message carrier in ancient Rome who failed his mission and was executed.\n\nThe moral was obvious.\n\nBut he never stated it.\n\nHe just told the story and let readers connect the dots.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nIt worked better than any logical argument ever could.\n\nBecause stories bypass resistance.\n\nLogic creates resistance.\n\nThis is why the best email writers rarely argue.\n\nThey just tell stories that make their point impossible to miss.\n\nAnd if you don't know how to do this?\n\nYou're working way too hard to make sales.\n\nEmail Players shows you exactly how to do this.\n\nHow to tell stories that sell without \"selling.\"\n\nHow to make points without arguing.\n\nHow to get people to convince themselves.\n\nIt's at:\n\nwww.EmailPlayers.com\n\nBen Settle",
