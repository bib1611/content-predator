  "body": "Dear Friend,\n\nDid you know that your family name may entitle you to your very own coat of arms?\n\nIt's true.\n\nAnd here's why this matters:\n\nFor centuries, coats of arms have been symbols of family heritage, honor, and distinction. They told stories of bravery, achievement, and lineage.\n\nBut here's the problem:\n\nMost families have lost track of their coat of arms over the years.\n\nThe records got scattered.\n\nThe knowledge got lost.\n\nThe heritage got forgotten.\n\nUntil now.\n\nYou see, I've just completed a 7-year research project that has identified and documented over 500,000 family coats of arms from around the world.\n\nAnd I'm willing to bet yours is in there.\n\nHere's exactly what you get:\n\n• A full-color reproduction of your family's authentic coat of arms - suitable for framing and displaying with pride\n\n• A detailed history of your family name - where it originated, what it means, and how it spread across the world\n\n• The story behind your coat of arms - what each symbol represents and what it says about your ancestors\n\n• A certificate of authenticity - documenting the heraldic research and validating your family's heritage\n\n• Instructions for using your coat of arms - on stationery, jewelry, and other family heirlooms\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking:\n\n\"This must be expensive.\"\n\nAnd normally, it would be.\n\nCustom heraldic research usually costs $500 to $1,000 or more.\n\nBut because I've already done the research and I can produce these in quantity, I'm able to offer your complete family coat of arms package for just $19.95.\n\nThat's right.\n\nLess than twenty dollars for a family heirloom that will last for generations.\n\nBut here's the catch:\n\nI can only do this if your family name is in my database.\n\nAnd I won't know that until you send me your name.\n\nSo here's what to do:\n\nSimply fill out the enclosed form with your family name (up to 3 names if you want to check your mother's maiden name or your spouse's name too).\n\nInclude your check or money order for $19.95 for each name you want researched.\n\nAnd I'll search my database.\n\nIf I find your coat of arms, I'll send you the complete package within 4-6 weeks.\n\nIf I DON'T find it, I'll refund your money immediately.\n\nNo questions asked.\n\nNo hassles.\n\nYou risk nothing.\n\nBut here's why you should act now:\n\nI'm limiting this offer to the next 500 responses.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause each coat of arms must be individually researched, designed, and printed.\n\nAnd I can only handle 500 orders at a time without the quality suffering.\n\nAfter that, I'll have to close this offer until I catch up.\n\nSo if you want to discover your family's heritage...\n\nIf you want to own a piece of history...\n\nIf you want to give your children and grandchildren a connection to their past...\n\nThen mail your order today.\n\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\nYour friend,\n\nGary Halbert\n\nP.S. Remember, you risk nothing. If I can't find your family's coat of arms, you get a full refund. But if I DO find it, you'll own a beautiful family heirloom for less than the cost of dinner for two. Mail your order today.",
