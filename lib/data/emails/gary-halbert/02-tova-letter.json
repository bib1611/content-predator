  "body": "Dear Friend,\n\nHer name is Tova Borgnine.\n\nAnd 15 years ago, she was a frumpy, overweight housewife with a failing marriage and no prospects.\n\nToday?\n\nShe's a multi-millionaire with her own perfume line, a successful marriage, and women all over the world trying to be like her.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nOne thing.\n\nAnd it wasn't what you think.\n\nIt wasn't a diet.\n\nIt wasn't a facelift.\n\nIt wasn't a new wardrobe.\n\nIt was a fragrance.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nYou see, Tova discovered something that scientists have known for years but nobody was using:\n\nThe sense of smell is the most powerful trigger of human emotion and memory.\n\nSmell something, and you're instantly transported back to a specific time, place, and feeling.\n\nIt bypasses your conscious mind and hits your emotions directly.\n\nAnd when you smell good - really good - something interesting happens:\n\nPeople treat you differently.\n\nThey're more attracted to you.\n\nMore interested in you.\n\nMore drawn to you.\n\nWithout knowing why.\n\nNow, Tova couldn't afford expensive French perfumes.\n\nSo she started experimenting with essential oils in her kitchen.\n\nMixing.\n\nTesting.\n\nTrying different combinations.\n\nUntil one day, she created something special.\n\nA fragrance that made people stop and notice her.\n\nA fragrance that made her feel confident, attractive, desirable.\n\nA fragrance that literally changed her life.\n\nHer husband noticed the change.\n\nTheir marriage improved.\n\nFriends started asking what perfume she was wearing.\n\nThen friends of friends.\n\nThen strangers.\n\nUntil finally, she was selling her homemade perfume to women all over Los Angeles.\n\nAnd that's when I met her.\n\nShe asked me to help her take her perfume national.\n\nAnd I said yes - but only if we could make it available to regular women at a reasonable price.\n\nNot $200 like French perfumes.\n\nNot even $100.\n\nBut just $39.95 for a full bottle that will last you 3-6 months.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking:\n\n\"If it's that cheap, it can't be that good.\"\n\nBut here's the thing:\n\nExpensive perfumes aren't expensive because of the ingredients.\n\nThey're expensive because of the advertising, the fancy bottles, the department store markups, and the designer names.\n\nThe actual perfume costs maybe $3 to make.\n\nTova's costs the same to make.\n\nBut we skip all the expensive stuff.\n\nNo fancy advertising campaigns.\n\nNo department store markups.\n\nNo designer name premium.\n\nJust a beautiful fragrance that works.\n\nAnd because we're so confident you'll love it, we're making you this guarantee:\n\nOrder Tova's perfume today.\n\nWear it for 30 days.\n\nSee how it makes you feel.\n\nSee how people respond to you.\n\nIf you're not absolutely thrilled with the results, send back even the empty bottle and we'll refund every penny.\n\nNo questions asked.\n\nYou literally cannot lose.\n\nEither this perfume changes your life like it did Tova's...\n\nOr you get your money back.\n\nBut I'll bet you keep it.\n\nBecause I've never met a woman who tried it and didn't fall in love with it.\n\nSo here's what to do:\n\nCall the number below and order your bottle of Tova perfume today.\n\nOr if you prefer, mail in the enclosed order form with your check or credit card information.\n\nEither way, you'll have your perfume within 10 business days.\n\nAnd 30 days from now, you'll understand why Tova went from frumpy housewife to millionaire.\n\nIt's not magic.\n\nIt's just the power of the right fragrance.\n\nOrder now.\n\nYour friend,\n\nGary C. Halbert\n\nP.S. This offer is limited to the first 1,000 orders. After that, we may have to increase the price to cover increased demand. So order now while the price is still just $39.95.",
