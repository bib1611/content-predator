  "body": "Dear Friend,\n\nIn 1961, Paul Anderson was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as \"The Strongest Man Who Ever Lived.\"\n\nHe could:\n\n• Lift 6,270 pounds off the ground (that's over 3 tons)\n• Squat 1,200 pounds for 2 reps\n• Bench press 600 pounds\n• Overhead press 400 pounds\n\nNo human being before or since has matched his strength.\n\nBut here's what's interesting:\n\nPaul Anderson didn't train like other strongmen.\n\nHe didn't spend 6 hours a day in the gym.\n\nHe didn't do endless sets of exercises.\n\nHe didn't follow any of the \"traditional\" training methods.\n\nInstead...\n\nHe trained for only 45 minutes a day.\n\n3 days a week.\n\nDoing just 3-5 exercises per workout.\n\nAnd he got stronger than anyone in human history.\n\nHow?\n\nHe discovered something that modern science has now proven:\n\nMore training does NOT equal more strength.\n\nIn fact, it's the opposite.\n\nYour muscles don't grow during your workout.\n\nThey grow during REST.\n\nThe workout just provides the stimulus.\n\nThe growth happens when you're recovering.\n\nSo if you're working out 6 days a week, doing 20 sets per muscle group, training for 2-3 hours at a time...\n\nYou're actually PREVENTING your muscles from growing.\n\nYou're breaking them down faster than they can recover.\n\nThis is why so many guys train for years and barely get any bigger or stronger.\n\nThey're overtraining.\n\nNow, I'm not a strongman like Paul Anderson.\n\nBut I've been studying strength training for over 20 years.\n\nAnd I've developed a program based on Paul Anderson's principles:\n\nShort workouts.\n\nMinimal exercises.\n\nMaximum rest.\n\nAnd maximum results.\n\nIt's called \"The 45-Minute Strength Solution.\"\n\nAnd here's exactly what you get:\n\n• The complete 12-week training program - exactly which exercises to do, how many sets, how many reps, which days to train\n\n• The \"overtraining test\" - a simple way to know if you're training too much (most guys are)\n\n• The \"perfect workout length\" formula - why 45 minutes is the magic number for muscle growth\n\n• The \"recovery maximizer\" protocol - how to ensure your muscles have everything they need to grow as fast as possible\n\n• Exercise substitutions - so you can train at home, at a gym, or anywhere in between\n\n• The \"plateau buster\" technique - what to do when you stop making gains (this alone is worth the price)\n\n• Nutrition guidelines - simple, no-BS advice on eating for strength (not complicated, just effective)\n\nNow, here's the deal:\n\nThis program works.\n\nI've tested it on myself and dozens of other guys.\n\nEvery single one got stronger.\n\nMost added 50-100 pounds to their bench press in 12 weeks.\n\nMany added 30-50 pounds of muscle.\n\nSome completely transformed their physiques.\n\nBut I can't guarantee you'll get those exact results.\n\nWhat I CAN guarantee is this:\n\nFollow this program exactly as written for 12 weeks.\n\nIf you're not significantly stronger and more muscular at the end...\n\nI'll refund every penny you paid.\n\nAnd you can keep the program.\n\nThat's how confident I am this works.\n\nThe investment?\n\nJust $47.\n\nLess than a single session with a personal trainer.\n\nLess than a month of gym membership at most places.\n\nFor a complete 12-week program that will make you stronger than you've ever been.\n\nTo order, simply fill out the form below and mail it with your payment.\n\nOr call the number at the bottom of this page to order by phone.\n\nYou'll receive the complete program within 7 business days.\n\nAnd 12 weeks from now, you'll be stronger than you ever thought possible.\n\nGuaranteed.\n\nYour friend in strength,\n\nGary C. Halbert\n\nP.S. Paul Anderson proved that more training isn't the answer. This program shows you exactly how to train LESS and get STRONGER. But you have to actually follow it.
