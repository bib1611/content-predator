  "body": "Dear Friend,\n\nYes, that really is a dollar bill taped to this letter.\n\nNo, it's not fake.\n\nAnd no, I'm not crazy.\n\nWell, maybe a little.\n\nBut here's why I did it:\n\nI need your attention.\n\nAnd I figured a dollar bill would get it.\n\nSee, I'm about to make you an offer that could literally change your financial future.\n\nBut only if you pay attention.\n\nSo I taped a dollar to this letter to make sure you'd read it.\n\nNow, here's the deal:\n\nThat dollar you're holding?\n\nIt's the most important dollar you'll ever receive.\n\nBecause I'm about to show you how to turn that single dollar into hundreds - even thousands - of dollars.\n\nNo, this isn't some get-rich-quick scheme.\n\nIt's not MLM.\n\nIt's not crypto.\n\nIt's not investing in stocks.\n\nIt's direct mail.\n\nStay with me here.\n\nYou see, that dollar I sent you cost me about $1.50 when you include:\n\n• The dollar itself ($1.00)\n• Printing this letter ($0.15)\n• The envelope ($0.05)\n• Postage ($0.30)\n\nSo I'm out $1.50 just to get your attention.\n\nWhy would I do that?\n\nBecause I know something most business owners don't:\n\nThe right customer is worth HUNDREDS of dollars in lifetime value.\n\nSo spending $1.50 to acquire them is a bargain.\n\nIn fact, I'd happily spend $10, $20, even $50 to acquire a good customer.\n\nBecause I know they'll spend far more than that over time.\n\nThis is the secret of direct mail.\n\nAnd it's the same secret that's made me and my clients millions of dollars.\n\nNow, most business owners don't understand this.\n\nThey think: \"I can't afford to spend money on marketing.\"\n\nBut the truth is:\n\nYou can't afford NOT to.\n\nEvery day you don't have a customer acquisition system is a day you're losing money.\n\nEvery competitor who DOES have a system is eating your lunch.\n\nEvery potential customer who never hears about you is buying from someone else.\n\nSo here's what I'm offering:\n\nI've just finished a new book called \"The Dollar Bill Secret.\"\n\nIt's 147 pages of pure, tested, proven direct mail strategies.\n\nIncluding:\n\n• How to calculate exactly how much you can afford to pay to acquire a customer (most people get this wrong and go broke)\n\n• The \"pattern interrupt\" formula - 17 different ways to grab attention in the mailbox (the dollar bill is just one)\n\n• The \"lifetime value maximizer\" - how to turn a $50 customer into a $5,000 customer over time\n\n• Case studies of 9 businesses that used these techniques to go from struggling to thriving\n\n• The complete \"anatomy of a winning sales letter\" - exactly what to say and in what order\n\n• How to test small and scale big - so you never risk more than $500 proving a campaign\n\n• The \"response predictor\" - how to know if your mail piece will work BEFORE you send it\n\nNow, here's the price:\n\nThis book would normally sell for $97.\n\nBut because I already have your attention (thanks to that dollar bill), I don't need to work as hard to sell you.\n\nSo I'm offering it for just $47.\n\nAnd here's my guarantee:\n\nRead the book.\n\nUse even ONE of the strategies.\n\nIf you don't make back at least 10 times your $47 investment in the next 90 days...\n\nI'll refund your $47 AND let you keep the book.\n\nYou literally cannot lose.\n\nTo order, just fill out the enclosed form and mail it back with your payment.\n\nOr call the number below to order by phone right now.\n\nYou'll get the book within 7 days.\n\nAnd 90 days from now, you'll understand why I was willing to tape a dollar bill to a letter to get your attention.\n\nBecause the right customer is worth FAR more than a dollar.\n\nAnd this book shows you how to find them.\n\nOrder now.\n\nYour friend in profit,\n\nGary C. Halbert\n\nP.S. Keep that dollar bill. Frame it. Put it on your wall. Let it remind you that every customer acquisition has a cost - and the businesses that understand this win. Everyone else loses.",
