  "body": "Dear Friend,\n\nHis name was Joe.\n\nAnd 5 years ago, he was a 32-year-old computer programmer making $35,000 a year.\n\nNo girlfriend.\n\nNo social life.\n\nNo prospects.\n\nJust another desperate nerd in a cubicle.\n\nBut then something happened.\n\nJoe discovered direct mail.\n\nAnd specifically, he discovered ONE letter.\n\nA letter he could send to a certain type of business owner.\n\nA letter that made them an offer they couldn't refuse.\n\nSo Joe did something crazy:\n\nHe rented a mailing list of 30,000 names.\n\nHe printed 27,000 copies of his letter. (He could only afford 27,000.)\n\nHe mailed them out.\n\nAnd then he waited.\n\nThree days later, the first check arrived.\n\n$500.\n\nThen another.\n\n$750.\n\nThen five more.\n\nThen ten more.\n\nThen they just kept coming.\n\nBy the end of the month, Joe had received:\n\n• 487 responses\n• $178,000 in orders\n• Enough profit to quit his job\n\nAnd he did.\n\nJoe sent that SAME letter again the next month.\n\nAnd the next.\n\nAnd the next.\n\nOver the next 3 years, Joe mailed that letter to over 200,000 business owners.\n\nHe made $3,000,000.\n\nFrom ONE letter.\n\nNow, I'm not telling you this to impress you.\n\nI'm telling you this to show you what's possible.\n\nBecause Joe's story isn't unique.\n\nI know dozens of people who've done the same thing:\n\n• Found one good offer\n• Wrote one good letter\n• Mailed it to the right list\n• Made a fortune\n\nIt's not complicated.\n\nBut it does require knowing the formula.\n\nAnd that's what I want to teach you.\n\nYou see, I've spent the last 25 years studying and writing direct mail.\n\nI've written letters that have generated over $100,000,000 in sales.\n\nAnd I've identified a pattern.\n\nA formula.\n\nA structure that works almost every time.\n\nIt's the same structure Joe used.\n\nThe same structure I use.\n\nThe same structure every successful direct mail letter follows.\n\nAnd I've put it all into a new course called:\n\n\"The Million Dollar Letter Formula\"\n\nHere's exactly what you get:\n\n• The complete letter formula - what to say, in what order, and why it works (this alone is worth thousands)\n\n• 17 proven headlines - templates you can use for any business (just fill in the blanks)\n\n• The \"offer engineering\" system - how to create offers people can't refuse (this is where most letters fail)\n\n• List selection secrets - how to find the right people to mail to (send to the wrong list and nothing works)\n\n• The \"response math\" calculator - know exactly how much profit you'll make before you mail (takes the gambling out)\n\n• Case studies of 12 million-dollar letters - see the formula in action across different industries\n\n• Templates and swipe files - ready-to-use letters you can model (just change the specifics)\n\n• The \"testing protocol\" - how to test small and scale big without risking your life savings\n\nNow, here's the investment:\n\nI could easily charge $1,000 for this course.\n\nAnd it would be worth it.\n\nBecause if you write just ONE successful letter, you could make that back hundreds of times over.\n\nJust like Joe did.\n\nBut I'm not charging $1,000.\n\nI'm not even charging $500.\n\nI'm charging $197.\n\nWhy so cheap?\n\nTwo reasons:\n\nFirst, I want as many people as possible to learn this.\n\nBecause direct mail works. And more people should be using it.\n\nSecond, I know that some of you who take this course will become clients.\n\nYou'll hire me to write letters for you.\n\nOr you'll buy my other courses and products.\n\nSo I'm willing to make this affordable to get you in the door.\n\nBut here's my guarantee:\n\nTake the course.\n\nLearn the formula.\n\nWrite your first letter using the system.\n\nMail it.\n\nIf you don't get AT LEAST a 2% response rate (which should generate at least 10x your investment), I'll refund every penny.\n\nNo questions asked.\n\nYou risk nothing.\n\nTo order, fill out the form below and mail it with your payment.\n\nOr call the number at the bottom to order by phone.\n\nYou'll get the complete course within 10 business days.\n\nAnd 90 days from now, you could be writing your own Joe story.\n\nOrder now.\n\nYour friend in profit,\n\nGary C. Halbert\n\nP.S. Joe's letter made $3,000,000 from 27,000 pieces of mail. That's $111 in revenue per letter mailed. Even if you only do 10% as well as Joe, you'd make $11 per letter. On a $0.50 letter, that's a 2,200% ROI. The question isn't whether this works. The question is: are you going to use it? Order now.",
